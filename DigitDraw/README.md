Creating a `README.md` file is essential for documenting your project and providing instructions for users and developers. Here’s a structured template you can use for your DigitDraw project:

# DigitDraw: Handwritten Digit Recognition

DigitDraw is a web application that allows users to draw handwritten digits and uses a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict the digit drawn.



## Features

- Draw digits on a canvas.
- Predict the drawn digit using a pre-trained CNN model.
- Clear the canvas and redraw as needed.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow
- Flask
- Pillow

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DigitDraw.git
   cd DigitDraw
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to use the application.
